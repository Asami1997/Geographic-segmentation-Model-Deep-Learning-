# Geographic-segmentation-Model-Deep-Learning-

<h2><b>Business Problem</h2></b>: A bank with millions of customers noticed an unusual churn rates and wants to uderstand what is causing the problem and get insights.They gave out a dataset which includes a sample of 10,000 customers who either left or stayed during a period of six months.  

THe goal is to create a Geographic segmentation model using Artficial Neural Networks that is able to predict which customers are at highest risk of leaving the bank.
